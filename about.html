	<p>We have design studios all over the country. Our main location is on Broadway right in the heart of NYC. We Are Broadway was established in 2013 by Roland Monroe, and has grown over its short four years. We have gone from one office here in NYC to twelve studios spread across the east coast.</p>
	
	<p>Our teams work with you from talking with you about your idea, to the point of bringing it to life. If your local we can setup meetings in person but for our out of state/international clients we still stay connected via online meetings.</p>
<!--	<p>You have the chance to spread your wings, all while knowing that you will always have help. We pride ourselves on team work, wether your working with a few people or your working in a large team your opinions, ideas, and voice will always be heard. Were not just a team here but were like a family. Your never alone when you get stuck on a project or just need a pair of fresh eyes.</p> -->
